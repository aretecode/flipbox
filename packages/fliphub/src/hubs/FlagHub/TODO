FLAGS
- [ ] should have a better handler for flags for so `withType`
      so you can do things with `ops` and `filter` such as
      `--compile=true / -c / --compile`
      but also
      `--compile=eh,canada`
- [ ] finish implementing commander as an extendable
- [ ] use commander as an implementation to handle flags as well to perform ops
      seems much cleaner
      plus we can handle subprocess for each as needed

- [ ] handle core ops + filtering not just from flags,
      but function calls as well
      and the flags should use those function calls to keep one api
      which internally does integration tests by ensuring client api is 1:1

- [ ] add app creation factory to handle other options like just passing in app without apps

- [ ] should allow npm lifecycle event hooks
- [ ] should allow `.` notation for accessing other flags?
- [ ] CHOOSE WHETHER FLAGS OVERRIDE OR NOT

ENV
- [ ] should allow extending other env,
      @example: default/undefined extends development
  - [ ] OR at least have an array with string properties to trigger
        (instead of obj keys) which merges them more easily

move ops to another class
  - should fix toConfig part
add workflow
remove `debugFor` and use the log filter












- [ ] fix needing to call `toConfig` before building
- [x] flags needs to be added earlier than calling whicg fglip..

- [ ] have an easy cli as easy as using babel and browserify

- [ ] could have some kind of flat mono config
```
  workflow
    - app
      - context
      - config
    - box
      - context
      - config
    - bundler
      - api
      - config
```

- [ ] defaults preset to reuse config at root to children unless not inheriting

- [ ] should finish other ops, clean up todos

# built in presets
!!!
- [x] flags preset
- [x] make presets work per app
- [ ] ensure presets do not conflict or merge or bleed across apps
  - [x] with buildFast they never do...
- [ ] + arithmetics for presets
- [x] see about using `fusebox` task runner to run them sync-or-async?
  - [x] too slow, not as good as buildFast
- [ ] think more about the presets-as-collections-of-plugins, adding a third type, decorators/middleware/core to do the more application logic
- [ ] could have another option when merging to `mergeReplace` if using conflicting settings
- [ ] could use observables to allow listening to changes so plugin order is less important...

- [ ] example with eslint loader
- [ ] es5/6 configs
- [ ] a good temporary file module
  - [ ] write a file to a location (example, tmp file backup, babelrc)
  - [ ] restore the file, or delete it

- [ ] try seeing what happens with more advanced configs - say taking a large config in webpack porting to fusebox or rollup
  - [ ] in configExtractor, should just take some props out, put them as preset args :-)

- [x] add the yuge example in without adding thousands of lines of code - just generate out the json

- [ ] instead of rollup loader with ts, consider adding running tsc first...
- [ ] run npm scripts, with the flags, and as config option, would solve the tsc part

- [x] build fliphub to include the dependencies...
- [ ] let `to` support an array of bundlers to bundle with all 3

!!!


- [x] built in presets get registered by config defaulter
  - [ ]  IF THERE IS NO DEFAULTS: FALSE
         https://github.com/fliphub/fliphub/issues/17
  -> this should actually be only for *using* the presets,
     not registering them

# debugging
- [x] add back debugging options
- [x] add arithmetic debugging options with tags
- [ ] fix debugging silence persisting or false positives that prevent `building...` orange log from echoing
  -> might not be calling `echo` somewhere

# presets
- [x] plugin indexes
- [ ] require.resolve the presets, only require when they are used
- [ ] aliasing for preset names
- [x] `cars` breaks rollup
  - [x] so ensure commonjs and node resolve are setup correctly

- [x] fix args
  - [x] should names be in https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#camelCase or https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#kebabCase https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#snakeCase?

- [x] plugin presets for fusebox such as babel

- [ ] try with packages/ts

- [x] `env` should properly use env
  - [x] which means detect current env
  - [ ] also means using flag preset to set the env first

====================================================
------------------------ p1 ------------------------
====================================================

# flags
- [ ] do a cleanup on flags,
- [ ] split into a class,
- [ ] make it safer,
- [ ] find-and-remove option
- [ ] better options,
- [ ] chainable
- [ ] support for ` -- ` handling (see how libs handle this)
- [ ] manage resetting argv so it is ignored if conflicting arguments...
// log.data(process.argv).text('argv').verbose().exit()

# presets
- [ ] https://github.com/fliphub/fliphub/issues/35 shim preset
- [ ] finish the rest of the required presets (in order)
  - []

# examples
- [ ] update all examples, ensure all of them work for all cases
- [ ] example running a monorepo
  - [ ] which asserts inheriting and resolver functionality
  - [ ] flush out autoalias
  - [ ] improve pkg tool

# tests
- [ ] add tests - assert based on the `.toConfig`
- [ ] run on travis to ensure deps are setup correctly

# docs & external
- [ ] pr neutrino-preset-happypack
- [ ] update readme

====================================================
------------------------ p3 ------------------------
====================================================

- [ ] shorten `PresetAliasRequire` + PresetAliasRequire -> PresetAlias

# simplification
- use module alias?

# flatten & clean
- [x] move index files to play folders
- [ ] flatten `hubs` and `core` more nicely with
  - [ ] `core`
  - [ ] bundlers
  - [ ] config
  - [ ] builtin ?
- [ ] clean presets/todo & presets/next

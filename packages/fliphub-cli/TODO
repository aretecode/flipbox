# cli
  - [ ] cleanup
  - [x] split up libs
  - [ ] define architecture
# flipfile
  - [x] flipfile should have glob-fs

- [ ] flipcmd?
  - [ ] could do defaults for every command here with defining production...
  - [x] change-file-then-restore

- [x] flipscript
- [ ] flippack
- [ ] easy-npm-files
- [ ] presets
- [ ] use fliphub-core?
- [ ] tests
- [ ] docs

- [ ] fliphub-resolve
  - [ ] extend with the helpers in src
  - [ ] improve scopes and reduce complexity
  - [ ] improve script running with execa

# flags
- [ ] do a cleanup on flags,
- [ ] split into a class,
- [ ] make it safer,
- [ ] find-and-remove option
- [ ] better options,
- [ ] chainable
- [ ] support for ` -- ` handling (see how libs handle this)
- [ ] manage resetting argv so it is ignored if conflicting arguments...

- [ ] instead of subscribing every built in hub & preset, connect them to a caller?
- [ ] only subscribe if used, at least

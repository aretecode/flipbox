- [x] need to have `bundler` and `bundlerConfig`

- [ ] should have `decorators` and `presets`? or `mixins`? to decorate the `box`?

- [ ] need to have `dry` run that installs deps if missing...
  - [ ] presets declare their deps
  - [ ] OR IF first run (store to file) try catch initial plugin setup, reset state

- [ ] could add `disable` prop to presets which would make presetter just not call them when user passes it in

- [x]
flipbox -> add flipconfig + api
app -> add appconfig
app -> add bundlerconfig

test using the Presets
-> [x] split up presets
-> put as modules
-> add flags preset

-> start cleaning bundler hub
-> start cleaning translator hub pt 2

-> [x] use env preset
-> use alias preset

- exec op is only for nodejs really
also note `webpack` to `webpack` if not flipping to other...



IF PRESETS ARE USED,
THEY COULD REGISTER KEYS THAT THEY EXTRACT
SO SAY `RESOLVEALIAS` WITH RESOLVE-ALIAS PRESET THEN IT COULD DELETE FROM IT
COULD USE `META` PROPERTY...
- maybe have an `adapt` fn that would pass in builder, and it could handle accordingly?

- OPS AS PRESETS!? THEN THEY CAN TRIGGER STUFF ON LIFECYCLE HOOKS... EASY SWAPPING... MELIKES

MAKE A PLAYGROUND FOR MERGING...
- MERGE STRING WITH OBJ O.O?

- add gulp, start, browserify, brunch, broccoli
- default hub should be special preset - inherited
- builder hub should be config hub

- give logs when using presets if you flip bundlers and that bundler is not supported

- [x] simplify helpers
- [x] reduce code base (breaking)
- [ ] convert defaults to presets
- [ ] convert config to webpack chain
- [ ] use config (remove builder?)
- [ ] simplify sourcemaps
- [ ] fix the broken ^

- [ ] improve cli
- [ ] add happypack neutrino preset?
- [ ] hub and chain as packages

// @TODO: should put resolve data in a file

- structure
-- fliphub.init(fliphubconfig).from('webpack').use(config)
-- fliphub.init(fliphubconfig).webpack(config).flipTo('fusebox')

- flags literally just has the ops...
- literally could just use `resolveDeep` on a config to resolve certain properties
and done for all resolving like aliasing and everything...
- could basically add `apps` wrapper to webpack with emphasis for monorepo so you can
  - filter your multiple apps
  - run your operations on your apps
  - use presets
  - have env presets baked in with disableable defaults

- [ ] to convert from bundler to bundler simply do
  -> from('webpack').to('fusebox')
  -> fromWebpack().toRollup()
  - [ ] which means simple adapters 1 to the other
  - [ ] then pull in the fliphub options
  - [ ] could externalize these flips... they can be operations too...
  - [ ] then optionally support X plugins from 1 to the other
  -> both of these can just be in rc files, forget it
     - [ ] babel
     - [ ] typescript ?

- [ ] make code splitting easier
- [ ] read through the existing neutrino presets
- [ ] differentiate from bundler presets and fliphub presets...?

- [ ] expand upon a rollup wrapper

- [ ] minimize config options, prioritize
  - [ ] improving `ops`
  - [ ] bundles with splitting
  - [ ] setting up

- [ ] a better webpack html plugin may be very helpful (just a simple wrapper)
  - [ ] replace paths
  - [ ] from selector

80/20
things that were causing the most headache:
supporting a mix of fusebox + rollup + webpack configs together
(extends 1st reason) having too intense adapters for going from-to and merging configs, should be taking 1 config from 1 bundler syntax, to 1 other bundler syntax

supporting flat plugins + loaders
```js
{
    name: 'basic',
    entry: './src/front/index.js',
    loaders: ['styleloader'],
    babel: true,
    define: {
      inferno: 'inferno',
    },
    params: {
      path: './dist',
      filename: '[name].js',
    },
    include: {
      'inferno': 'inferno',
    },
}
```

which extends the first problem as well
and then the second biggest problem
is defaults + presets
webpack chain allows easy merging of those presets, and allows me to extend it for multiple application presets, as well as presets for other bundlers, without dealing with exhaustive merging
take one config -> output as another config
defaults should just be presets that are applied by default, not their own kind of presets
then another issue I was having is I was really mixing the fliphub config with the apps config, split them up, allow apps to inherit and modify the config, and it is much simpler and more powerful
and when defaults + presets + mixture of configs isn't dealt with and the fliphub config is more clearly defined, the application becomes exponentially more simple and easier to deal with and can provide a solid solution

save you lots of trouble:
- absolute paths
- public paths
- aliases

cause lots of trouble:
- style loading
- context
- using `vue`


biggest issue hands down is style loading with less/sass/scss/css/prefixing/cssnext etc
second biggest is due

other common ones are typescript and paths, but those problems are usually fixed

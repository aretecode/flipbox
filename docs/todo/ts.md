- ts force reformatting your code when you compile,
- not understanding spread syntax on maps with es5 target,
- having to run dist every time I want to just run a node file,
- having to do * as pkg as it uses non standard import syntax,
- not understanding if I pass ina string or string[] or Array<string> and cast a string to an array that it can be looped
- trying to enforce rules that would be required in an actually strongly typed language on a super loosely typed language which is trying to make a language seem like something that it is not which in turn reduces many of the benefits the language has to offer
- not understanding multi inheritence with public properties defined on constructors - constructor(public parent: any) yet in 3 classes down the class says property "parent" is not on class ThreeDown

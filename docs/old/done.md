- [x] set up extensible first
- [x] register handlers
- [x] builder should be extensible
  - [x] then decorate for flags
  HUGE PROBLEM
  - [x]~ concurrency
  - how can HUBS decorate fusebox if they init each app first...
  basic easy starter:
  - just an app with aliasing
  - ignore the rest
  - log
  - add incrementally
  - autodecorate commander for presets!
  - [ ] need to fix
    - [x] pm context per app
    - [x] translator context per app

  - [x] need loader configs like babel to be setup elsewhere
    - [x] setup in translation,
    - [x] listen for loaders first,
    - [x] then it goes to builder
